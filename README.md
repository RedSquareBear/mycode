# mycode (Project Title)

I am interested in learning if there is any rhyme or reason to how version numbers are created/used or if it is just whatever the developer feels like putting. One Paragraph of your project description goes here. Describe what you're trying to do.
What is the purpose of putting up this repo?

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project
on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things are needed to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in
"how to install python and python3 using apt."
